With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, effectively utilizing distributed data while preserving privacy has become a critical challenge. This paper proposes a secure federated learning framework integrating blockchain and reputation token mechanisms to address data privacy protection, security maintenance, and participant incentivization in IoT environments.The framework leverages blockchain's decentralization and immutability to design a dynamic reputation token mechanism via smart contracts, which rewards participants based on their model training contributions and long-term performance. To mitigate potential malicious behaviors, the proposed approach introduces multi-dimensional anomaly detection models that comprehensively assess nodes' historical behaviors and current contributions. Moreover, the framework implements a role-based participation model, enabling devices with diverse computational capabilities to engage and receive corresponding incentives.Experimental results demonstrate the framework's robustness: when confronted with data pollution and label flipping attacks from up to 30\% malicious nodes, the method limits model performance degradation within 5\% and achieves a malicious node detection rate exceeding 94\%. The innovative reputation evaluation mechanism systematically distinguishes participant behaviors, causing honest nodes' reputations to progressively increase while malicious nodes' reputations exponentially decline with each malicious act. These findings suggest significant potential for secure and efficient federated learning in IoT and edge computing domains.
